export const useAuth = () => {
  const context = useContext(AuthContext);
  if (!context) {
    throw new Error('useAuth must be used within AuthProvider');
  }
  return context;
};

[... complete implementation ...]

// To implement:
// 1. Copy AuthContext.jsx to src/contexts/
// 2. Copy Login.jsx to src/components/
// 3. Wrap App with AuthProvider
// 4. Use ProtectedRoute for secure pages

### 🎨 **Chat Vibe Coding - Natural Language Magic**

**Emotional Request:**
```
User: I want a meditation app that feels like a peaceful zen garden

Chat Vibe Response:
I need to create a meditation app with a peaceful zen garden atmosphere.

From your vision, I understand:
- Emotional goal: Peace, calm, serenity, mindfulness
- Visual translation: Soft greens, natural textures, gentle movements
- Interaction feel: Smooth, unhurried, contemplative
- Audio elements: Nature sounds, gentle chimes

Here's your zen garden meditation app:

// ZenMeditation.jsx
// Creates a peaceful zen garden experience
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const ZenMeditation = () => {
  const [breathing, setBreathing] = useState('inhale');
  
  // Breathing rhythm that matches natural patterns
  useEffect(() => {
    const cycle = setInterval(() => {
      setBreathing(prev => prev === 'inhale' ? 'exhale' : 'inhale');
    }, 4000); // 4 seconds per phase
    
    return () => clearInterval(cycle);
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="zen-container">
      <div className={`breathing-circle ${breathing}`}>
        <span className="breathing-text">{breathing}</span>
      </div>
      
      {/* Floating lotus petals for ambiance */}
      <div className="lotus-petal petal-1"></div>
      <div className="lotus-petal petal-2"></div>
    </div>
  );
};

/* Zen garden atmosphere styling */
.zen-container {
  min-height: 100vh;
  background: linear-gradient(to bottom, #E8F5E8, #C8E6C9);
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  overflow: hidden;
}

.breathing-circle {
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  background: radial-gradient(circle, #81C784, #66BB6A);
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  transition: transform 4s ease-in-out;
}

.breathing-circle.inhale {
  transform: scale(1.2);
}

.breathing-circle.exhale {
  transform: scale(0.8);
}

@keyframes float {
  0%, 100% { transform: translateY(0) rotate(0deg); }
  50% { transform: translateY(-20px) rotate(180deg); }
}

.lotus-petal {
  position: absolute;
  width: 40px;
  height: 40px;
  background: #FFB7C5;
  border-radius: 0 50% 0 50%;
  opacity: 0.6;
  animation: float 8s ease-in-out infinite;
}

// To create your zen garden:
// 1. Copy this code to ZenMeditation.jsx
// 2. Import in your App.js
// 3. Add nature sounds (optional)
// 4. Experience peaceful meditation
