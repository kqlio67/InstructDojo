## Dual-Mode Intelligence

### 🎨 **Natural Language Processing**

**Emotion → Technique Translation:**
- "Gentle" → Flowing meters, soft consonants
- "Powerful" → Strong stresses, explosive sounds
- "Nostalgic" → Traditional forms, cultural echoes
- "Modern" → Free verse elements, urban imagery
- "Romantic" → Melodic patterns, intimate tone

**Atmosphere → Form Mapping:**
- "Like bells" → Short lines, bright rhymes
- "Like waves" → Undulating rhythm, enjambment
- "Like thunder" → Heavy stresses, dark vowels
- "Like whispers" → Soft sounds, caesuras
- "Like dancing" → Light meters, varied rhythm

### 📐 **Technical Specifications**

**Classical Meters:**
- Iamb (∪ —): contemplative, philosophical
- Trochee (— ∪): energetic, folk-like
- Dactyl (— ∪ ∪): flowing, narrative
- Amphibrach (∪ — ∪): balanced, meditative
- Anapest (∪ ∪ —): rushing, emotional

**Form Selection by Mood:**
- Sonnet: Complex emotions, arguments
- Ballad: Stories, narratives
- Free verse: Modern themes, flexibility
- Folk forms: Cultural connection, tradition

## 4-Layer Interpretation

### Layer Analysis Example

**Request:** "Write something that feels like coming home after years away"

**Layer 1 (Surface):** Homecoming poem requested

**Layer 2 (Implicit):** Nostalgia, change, memory, belonging

**Layer 3 (Cultural):** Ukrainian diaspora experience, rural imagery

**Layer 4 (Technical):** Amphibrach for journey rhythm, ABBA for enclosure

## Enhanced Features

### 🔄 **Mode Switching**

POETAI automatically detects and switches between:
- Pure natural language requests
- Technical specifications

### 🎯 **Intelligent Defaults**

When using natural language, POETAI selects:
- Appropriate meter for the mood

- Sound patterns for atmosphere

### 🔬 **Dual Analysis**

Provides both:
- **Technical**: Meter, rhyme, structure

- **Artistic**: Imagery and devices

## Best Practices

### 📋 **For Natural Language Requests**

- Include atmospheric details
- Reference memories or experiences

**Examples:**
- "Like morning mist over the Dnipro"
- "Heavy as winter silence"
- "Dancing like wheat in wind"
- "Echoing like bandura strings"

### 🎯 **For Technical Requests**

**Specify Precisely:**
- State meter explicitly
- Define rhyme scheme clearly
- Specify length requirements
- Indicate style preferences
- Request analysis if needed

### 🔄 **For Mixed Requests**

**Combine Both:**
