На пухнастих білих крилах,
Принесли тобі, малений,
Казки з золота та срібла.

## TECHNICAL UKRAINIAN SONNET:

Прокинулась земля від зимових снів,        A
Зелений шум пробився крізь кору,           B
І сонце золотом вмиває гаї й бори,         B
Де вчора панував сніговий покрив.          A

Струмки дзвенять, як срібні голоси,        A
Пророкують про радість і надію,            B
Калина квітне, і душа співає гію           B
Про воскресіння і про зміни часи.          A

Так і народ мій після важкої зими          C
Підводить плечі й дихає повною            D
Груддю, готовий знову творити,            C

І мова рідна лине над землею             D
Весняним дощем, що дає силу жити,         C
Й душа розквітне, як цвіт на галявині.     D
